Suddenly, I can’t seem to remember I'm sorry that I laughed at you so hard. At a loss for words, it just came out Man cannot live without one another. There’s no mistake about that You’re always a part of something bigger, whether your family, school, or society itself Your name's written on your name tag. Or maybe it's written on your business card Or maybe it's written on your medical records. So many shadows whisper out to you They know you by titles, gossip, and nicknames. To tell the truth, I really hate all of those How about we get to know each other first? Then maybe we'll understand each other Whether a liar, idealist, or dreamer; If you have depression, whichever side you fall on; All we’re doing is trying to live our lives. The only thing that’s different is our names If you have social anxiety disorder, whether you like rock, pop, or folk songs; Does any of it really matter? If you would, won’t you listen to my story? When I was in elementary school, everyone always liked to call me “Slick.” I spent my time trying to read their faces, and changing how I acted accordingly Of course, once I’d gotten into music, they started calling me the “Bandman.” And shortly after I graduated high school, everyone called me “Mr. Part-Time.” Nothing’s really changed about me, since I was that little punk kid My name was the only thing that changed, based on the time, place, and circumstances So try not to get so down about it. I understand what you are going through You asked me who the hell I was? Tell me who the hell you are first! Whether a debtor or a good-for-nothing bum, if you’re unemployed and don’t want to live anymore All we’re doing is trying to live our lives. The only thing that’s different is our names Whether insensitive, conservative, or liberal; Whether a truant, middle school or high school graduate; Does any of it really matter? If you wouldn’t mind, could you tell me your story? Every now and then I‘m made to carry some gaudy signboard Every now and then I‘m accused of some unspeakable offense How many names could tell your whole life’s story in a single word? I bet you can’t think of very many, can you? So tell me Now what sort of word should we know you as? I think you should pick the word you like best What sort of name would you choose for yourself? Reducing everything you’ve done to one word isn’t very elegant Whether a thug, victim, or culprit; Whether a loser, bystander, or suspect; All we’re doing is trying to live our lives. The only thing that’s different is our names If you’re neurotic or a narcissistic criminal, if you’re homeless or a day-laborer Does any of it really matter?
