# [Spotify Usage Data Analysis](https://github.com/nazhifkojaz/my-spotify-usage-analysis/)

This is a fun project where I do various data science-y kinda things on my own spotify usage data.
## [Data Collection](https://github.com/nazhifkojaz/my-spotify-usage-analysis/blob/main/spanalysis_datacollect.ipynb)
This jupyter notebook includes:
- Explain the data I'm using and how to obtain/request it from spotify
- Preparing the data and separated the music and podcast streaming history
- Collecting additional data using [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/)
- Simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) in order create a to-do list for the data cleaning/processing stage

## [Data Analysis](https://github.com/nazhifkojaz/my-spotify-usage-analysis/blob/main/spanalysis_dataanalysis.ipynb)
This jupyter notebook includes:
- Analysing the trend in my streaming activity on spotify through out the year (like activity per month/year, top artists, etc)
- Checking if there is any correlation in the quantity of tracks I listened from an artist to the overall streaming duration (and also its average streaming duration)
- Visualizing my top artists and how much I have listened to their music throughout my subscription in spotify using [Bar Chart Race](https://www.dexplo.org/bar_chart_race/) library

## Notes
the list goes on as I add new things. This project will serve as a practice project where as I explore more the world of data science and machine learning.
if you have any suggestion on things I should try on, feel free to shoot a message on my [Twitter / X](https://twitter.com/nazhifkojaz).
